# Spotify_Playlist
Creating a Spotify Playlist for any date in Billboards Top 100 Chart. I used BeautifulSoup to scrap the data from Billboards website from the date that was inputted into the terminal. Then, I extracted those song titles and added them to a list. Finally, I used Spotify's API to create a playlist and find those songs and add them to the new playlist.

I used the Python Spotify module Spotipy to complete this project, and it was the hardest part. The documentation, like most, was very complex and a lot to read. Most notably, I had the most trouble with the authentication and searching for the songs by title. Once I got those down, creating the playlist and adding the songs was smooth sailing. There are still a few bugs, the biggest being that it is set up to search for songs created in the year for the date you are searching for (so if you search for top songs on February 1st, 2023 it will only find songs created in 2023.) I thought about adding artist and removing year to search for songs, but then there was the problem of Spotify not like songs that have feauturing artists, so I am still trying to figure this out and will try to come back to it in the future. Another issue is that my webscraping could be a bit more precise as it adds at the end of the song list some items that aren't songs, but I caught this when finding the song URI's to avoid those as an exception and it won't affect the code. Despite those minor things, the code runs and I am able to add a playlist for any day of the year. I chose to add today's date just so I can stay up-to-date on todays hottest songs!
